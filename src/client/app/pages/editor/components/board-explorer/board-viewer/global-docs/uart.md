# UART
Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) is the microchip that 
controls the boardâ€™s interface to attached devices. UART is part of an 
integrated circuit and allows the board to exchange data with the serial devices, 
including modems. One end of the UART consists of data lines, while the other 
side has two serial wires. The data format and transmission speeds are configurable.
