# I2C
Inter-integrated Circuit (I2C) is a protocol that connects low-speed processors 
and microcomputers to integrated circuits. Its simplicity and flexibility 
make it a popular choice: it is a multi-master, multi-slave serial computer bus 
where only the upper bus speed is defined. Each slave device has a unique address 
and a near unlimited number of devices can be connected by only two wires 
(serial data [SDA] and serial clock [SCL]) with pull-up resistors.
