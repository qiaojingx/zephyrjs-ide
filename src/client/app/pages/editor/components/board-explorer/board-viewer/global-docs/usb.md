# USB
Universal Serial Bus (USB) is an interface that enables communication and 
power supply between the board and electronic devices. USB generally refers 
to the cables and ports that connect devices such as mice, keyboards, printers, 
and flash drives. The main types of USB cables are A (standard) and B 
(standard, mini, and micro). No reboot or restart is required with a USBâ€”the 
operating system (OS) will discover the device on its own.
