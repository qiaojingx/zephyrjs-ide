# SPI
The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is an interface bus that enables 
short-distance serial data exchange between a master and one or more slave devices. 
The devices that can be controlled by an SPI include memory chips, printers, 
data storage devices, microprocessors, and sensors. Data is transferred in both 
directions at the same time, but only one side generates the clock signal 
(master, i.e., the board), while the other side can have multiple slaves.
