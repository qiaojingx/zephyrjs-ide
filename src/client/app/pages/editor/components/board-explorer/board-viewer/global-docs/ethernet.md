# Ethernet
Ethernet is the most popular way to connect computers and devices on a 
wired Local Area Network (LAN) so they can communicate with each other.  
Ethernet defines the physical connections as well as the protocols, transmission
formats, and addressing schemes so information sent
from one computer reliably gets to its destination in an orderly way.
