# Common definitions

The following definitions should be concise. They will be displayed with
minimal screen realestate to provide ancillary context to other documentation.

GPIO
:   General-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins are generic pins, meaning they do not have a predefined function.

PWM
:   Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) is a modulation technique that controls the amount of voltage given to a device.

I2C
:   Inter-integrated Circuit (I2C) is a protocol that connects low-speed processors and microcomputers to integrated circuits.

SPI
:   The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is an interface bus that enables short-distance serial data exchange between a master and one or more slave devices.

UART
:   Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) is the microchip that controls the board’s interface to attached devices.

USB
:   Universal Serial Bus (USB) is an interface that enables communication and power supply between the board and electronic devices.

I2S
:   I²S (Inter-IC Sound, Integrated Interchip Sound, or IIS) is an electrical serial bus interface standard that connects digital audio devices.

Ethernet
:   Ethernet is a local area network (LAN) technology. It is a standard communications and link layer protocol, and the most popular LAN.

HSE
:   Located on the reverse side of the board, the white high speed expansion (HSE) connector is a 60-pin, high-density connector for high-speed I/O.

LSE
:   Located on the top side of the board, the low speed expansion connector (LSE) is a 26-pin header connector for low-speed I/O.

microSD
:   MicroSD (Secure Digital) is the smallest type of removable flash memory card used for information storage in portable devices.

microHDMI
:   MicroHDMI is a smaller version of the High-Definition Multimedia Interface that connects the board to HDMI-compatible audio/video devices including computer monitors.
