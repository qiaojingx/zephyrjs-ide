# PWM
Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) is a modulation technique that controls the amount 
of voltage given to a device. It does this by regulating the amplitude of digital 
signals, thereby controlling power applications including electrical devices 
and motors. It can also be used to encode messages for transmission. 
Power loss is minimal with PWM and examples of what it may be used for include 
controlling LED dimming and DC motors.
