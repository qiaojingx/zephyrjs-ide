# GPIO
General-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins provide a software-configurable 
physical interface between the board and the outside world. Unlike most other 
board pins that have a specific and dedicated purpose, you can program 
GPIO pins to accept a signal input from a physical device such as a switch or  
temperature sensor or to send signal output to control devices such as an LED, 
LCD display, or audio device.  GPIO pins can only read or write either a 0 or 1 
(off or on).  You'll need some hardware knowledge to make sure connected 
devices use compatible voltage levels and are properly connected so they or 
the board aren't hurt.
